         *
         * 1) Add a new property to the player objects
         *    called healthMultiplier.
         *
         * 2) Add a third parameter to the definition
         *    of the showPlayerHealth function
         *    called playerHealthMultiplier
         *
         * 3) Update the function so that the health
         *    displayed is first multiplied by
         *    the health multiplier.
         *
         * 4) Add the player's healthMultiplier property
         *    as a third argument to the two calls
         *    to the showPlayerHealth function.
