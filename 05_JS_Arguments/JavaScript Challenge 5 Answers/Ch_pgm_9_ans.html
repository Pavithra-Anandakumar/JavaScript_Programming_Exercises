         *
         * 1) Change the showPlayerHealth function
         *    so it shows information of the form:
         *    Kandra: health 50.
         *
         * 2) Call the showPlayerHealth function
         *    using your own arguments.
         *
         * 3) Declare a variable called healthInfo
         *    inside the showPlayerHealth function.
         *
         *    var healthInfo;
         *
         * 4) Assign healthInfo the string that
         *    will be displayed.
         *
         *    healthInfo = playerName + ": health " + playerHealth;
         *
         * 5) Change the call to console.log so that
         *    it uses the healthInfo variable.
