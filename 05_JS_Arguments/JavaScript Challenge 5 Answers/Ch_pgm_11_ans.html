         * 1) Inside the console.log brackets,
         *    change playerName to playerName[0]
         *    Run the program.
         *    What effect do the brackets have? Only I got the first letter of the player
         *
         * 2) Change the number in the brackets to 1.
         *
         * 3) What happens when you change the
         *    number to 3? Why? I got the output based on the player name's Index value
