        /* Further Adventures
         *
         * 1) Create a showPlayerInfo function with three
         *    parameters, playerName, playerHealth and
         *    playerPlace.
         *
         * 2) Call getPlayerHealth and getPlayerPlace
         *    from your new showPlayerInfo function.
         *
         *    e.g. showPlayerInfo("Dax", 50, "The Bath")
         *    should produce the output
         *
         *    Dax has health 50
         *    Dax is in The Bath
         *
