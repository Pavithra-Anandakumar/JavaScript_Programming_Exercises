        /* Further Adventures
         *
         * 1) What is the cost for 12 hours work?
         *
         * 2) The plumber sometimes issues discount coupons.
         *    Add a fourth parameter to the totalCost
         *    function definition to account for discounts.
         *
         * 3) Update the function to subtract the discount
         *    from the total before returning it.
         *
         * 4) If a customer has a $20 off coupon,
         *    update the call to totalCost
         *    to display the total cost.
         *    It should now be $130 for 3 hours.
