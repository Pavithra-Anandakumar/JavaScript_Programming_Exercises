        /* Further Adventures
         *
         * 1) Add a fifth score to the array.
         *
         * 2) Add an extra console.log to display the new score.
         *
         * The index of the last element is one less than
         * the length of the array.
         *
         * 3) Log the value of the last element to the console.
         *    Start the message with "The last score is " and
         *    concatenate the score to the string.
         *    Use an expression involving scores.length
         *    as the index for the last element.
         *
         * 4) Add an extra score to the array and 
         *    run the program again.
