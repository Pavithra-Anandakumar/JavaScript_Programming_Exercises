        /* Further Adventures
        *
        * 1) Write code to increase player1's score by 10%.
        *
        * 2) Add a second player.
        *
        * 3) Use the players' properties to find the sum
        *    of their scores and log it to the console,
        *    along with an appropriate message that includes
        *    their names.
